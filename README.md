# Etre -- An Experimental Mathematical Approach to Bioinformatics in Rust.
# NOT READY FOR ANYTHING SERIOUS.

For serious work there is [rust-bio](https://github.com/rust-bio/rust-bio).

This is a sibling project to [quartz](https://github.com/krhoda/quartz). It is an attempt to bring category theory, lattice-variables, and type-level programming to Bio-informatics, but it is in too early of stages to even propose a roadmap. It also kicks in the tires of ideas being explored quartz.

Ideally, this would offer type-safe automatically-parallel algorithms that would be efficient in speed and memory footprint, and make maximum usage of parallization. Who knows?
